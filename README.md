# HHVM Design Patterns

A collection of design patterns for use with [HHVM](http://hhvm.com).


## Why?

I wanted to use generics, and some of the other features provided by HHVM, and thought this would be a good way to try them out.


## Patterns

* [AbstractFactory](AbstractFactory.php)
* [Factory](Factory.php)
* [Singleton](Singleton.php)


## Usage

``` php
// @todo Write this usage documenation.
```
